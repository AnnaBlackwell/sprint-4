Use the AccessLint lint to check three of your favorite web pages. Suggestion: pick information-heavy sites, not applications. List each site and give a short description of what you learned about it's accessibility.

Trademe.co.nz:

Low contrast: 194 results. The trademe homepage has quite a few areas of low contrast, for example the grey-on-white subtitles throughout.

Meaningful images should not be used in element backgrounds: 48 results. This seems to apply to the 'add to watchlist' button that expands when hovered over. I'm not sure why access lint sees this as less accessible.

Elements are focusable but invisible or obscured by another element: 52 results. This applies to many links. These seem to be the links to all the trademe categories (Antiques and collectibles, baby gear....) but I can't see how these are invisible or obscured.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element:

The main problems with this page is text with low contrast (400 results). This appears to be the blue link text on the gray background.

http://www.w3.org/:

The W3C website has very few issues, with 2 text elements with low contrast, and 3 positive integers values for tabIndex (though I'm not sure of the implications of this).
