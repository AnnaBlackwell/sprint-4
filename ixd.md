What is the difference between IxD and UX?

-Interaction Design (IxD) is about facilitating interactions between users and their computers, while UX is about all user-facing aspects of a system.

What is goal-driven design? (GDD)

-GDD is design that focusses on allowing users to achieve their goals or solve their problems.

What does it mean to say that "the best interaction designs donâ€™t exist"?

-This means ideal interaction design is so seamless to the user that they don't think of it as an interaction.

Remind us again, what's an "affordance"? And what do you think a "bad affordance" might be? Can you think of any examples in the physical world?

-Affordance is where an object's characteristics communicate how it should be used, e.g. links look like links, and buttons look like buttons.

Examples of bad affordance would be:

  -buttons that are, or look to be inactive

  -signs for a lift/elevator can confuse people because they often use the same male/female symbols that are typically used for bathrooms

Under what circumstance should interaction designers take great effort in making that interface learnable? What kinds of knowledge and skills do they need to do this?

-If the design problem at hand calls upon a unique interface, interaction designers should make sure that the interface is easily learned. This requires knowledge of design conventions, affordances and overall web usability.

What do you think one of the hardest parts of being an interaction designer is? Do you think this applies to full-stack web developers as well?

-One difficult part about being an interaction designer is keeping up-to-date with the way the design industry changes. I think this does apply to full-stack web developers.
