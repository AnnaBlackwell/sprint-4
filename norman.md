What kind of thinking does fear and happiness cause?

-Fear and anxiety cause to you to focus (depth first).

-Happiness causes you to think more creatively (breadth first).

What are the three ways that good design makes you happy?

1. At the Visceral level (biological). By our nature, we like and dislike certain things for survival purposes; we like bright colours (like fruit) and smiling, symmetrical faces, and dislike bitter flavours (indicating poison), loud sounds, and extreme temperatures.
2. At the Behavioural level (subconscious). This is about feeling in control, including usability and understanding. This is why people like a well-balanced knife, or a high performance car.
3. At the Reflective level (state of consciousness). This is about one's ego, such as buying a particular product to impress people, or be seen to be good to the environment.
