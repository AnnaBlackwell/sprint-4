Explain the difference between absolute and relative URLs. Give one reason why relative URLs might be better.

An absolute url contains the full domain, would be coded like this:
&lt;a href= "http://website.com/page"&gt;
Absolute urls can be used to link to internal or external pages.

A relative url is abbreviated, and would be coded like this:
&lt;a href= /page&gt;
Relative urls are used to link to internal pages in your website.

Relative urls are faster and easier to code compared with absolute urls.

Give at least two reasons why the author thinks that absolute URLs are better:

1. Reduce scraper risk: With relative links, it would be easy for a scraper to take the whole website and put it on another domain, and the whole site would work.  

2. Reduce duplicate content risk. Absolute links reduce the number of versions of web pages.

Explain what the author means by "four different sites". What the heck is she talking about?

The author is referring to the variants of a website, such as:

http://www.website.com

http://website.com

https://www.website.com

https://website.com

Google sees these four websites as four separate domains. They may have duplicate content, or link to a single 'real' version of the site.

What is crawl budget and why is it important to your website?

The crawl budget is the number of pages a search engine will crawl each time it visits the site. When Google crawls websites, it crawls a finite number of urls (depending on page rank, site authority, complexity, and update frequency). Crawling costs google actual money (bandwith on servers) so if the site is not efficient, google will crawl fewer pages and less frequently.
