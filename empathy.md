Search Inside Yourself Chapter 4 Reflections:

Last week I downloaded a guided mindfulness app (buddify) which has been fine so far. As with all new habits it's had to get it to stick in at first, so I'm struggling to get mindfulness embedded as a habit (I mainly just forget about it, or put it off because I generally find meditation boring). It's an attractive app, at least! I think I'll be at the baby's plateau of 2 steps before falling for a while. It's easier for me to do the one mindful breath per day, as discussed in the previous chapter, which must surely be better than nothing!
