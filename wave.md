For the same three web pages, use the WAVE lint to do the same thing. Record what you learned and how the WAVE results differed from the AccessLint results.

Trademe.co.nz:

WAVE identified similar issues with this website. The main problems are contrast errors with the gray subheading text, which is also too small. Some of the links/buttons don't appear to have any text, resulting in errors.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element:

WAVE also picked up a high number of contrast errors. It identified that there are are a lot of ARIA roles throughout the page. Links with no text caused some errors.

http://www.w3.org/:

Only 2 errors were found, which were for missing form label and empty button. These are different to the ones identified in Access Lint, but both identified a very small number of problems.
