Discuss how you would apply the lessons learned here to the form you created in section 2 of this sprint (form.html):

In my ‘form.html’ file, I included placeholder values that were identical to the label, for text, email, and tel input types. Because the placeholders I included didn’t add any hints or additional information, they don’t add any value to my form, nor would they cause usability problems. All of these placeholders could be removed with basically no change to the form.
